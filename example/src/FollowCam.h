    // gotten pretty close. You need to figure out how to directly calculate the
    // axis and angle so you don't have to do this in two steps. Then it should
    // Just Work.
    // 
    // Although you may have to figure out how to make the camera keep a consistent up vector.
    // 
    // Actually that shouldn't be too hard, because once you have a quaternion
    // LookAt thing, you can just always pass world up to it.
